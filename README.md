// Unit Testing

Unit Testing:

Unit Testing is a type of software testing in which individual units or components of a software application are tested in isolation from the rest of the system. It is usually performed by developers during the development process to ensure that each unit of code is working as intended. Unit tests are typically automated and focus on testing individual functions, methods, or classes.

// Functional Testing 

Functional Testing:

Functional Testing is a type of software testing that evaluates the software system against functional requirements. The goal of functional testing is to ensure that the software application is working as expected and meets the specified requirements. Functional testing is usually performed after unit testing and may involve testing multiple components of the system together.

// Integration Testing 

Integration Testing:

Integration Testing is a type of software testing in which individual software components are combined and tested as a group. The goal of integration testing is to ensure that the different components of the system work together as intended and to identify any defects that may arise from the interaction between components. Integration testing is usually performed after unit testing and before system testing.
